<!-- Goal: Create a roadmap of the syllabus, what the concepts we are covering will look like, etc. 

Way to get after it: Modularize each line item on the syllabus, add in text & images

Maybe write this as a table? Four columns: Image, title, description, source code

If image is faded, we haven't done it yet. If image is full color, we have completed it already. -->
